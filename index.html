    <h1 id="title">Hi, I'm <span>Turner</span></h1>

    <p id="bio">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m a junior software developer in Metro Vancouver with a focus on back-end web
        development. As a graduate of the Computer Systems Technology diploma program at the British Columbia Institute
        of Technology I’ve had hands-on experience with a wide variety of technologies and numerous projects where I
        have worked on all parts of the software development workflow, from scoping requirements with the customer to
        implementation and deployment. Working directly with customers has given me a well-rounded view of both how
        software is built and used, and I’m passionate about working to fulfill their business needs and immensely enjoy
        engaging with them to accomplish that. Most of my experience is in back-end web development and I am working to
        improve my skills in that area as well as branch out into other parts of the web stack.
